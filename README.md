# Employee-Summary

This application is a team summary generator. Using a CLI, the user can input their teams information and it will create a readable profile page with key information about each team member. 

## How to use

This application uses a Command-line Interface, or CLI. The user will run it by typing "node app.js" in the terminal of the app.js file. The user will then be prompted with several questions including their name, email, id number, and office number.
